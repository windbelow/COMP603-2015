Findings
Identify which files/functions are responsible for each phase in the compiler source (scan/lex/tokenize, parse, AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), optimization, code generation).

What was the most ridiculous thing you found? (funny comments? awful code?)

Take notes along the way (if you find something that’s unrelated to a compiler phase, try to infer what it’s doing).

Write up your findings in a short document and post to your repository (no more than two pages, please). For example:


Compiler CPython

parser.c file contains code for Parser implementation
tokenizer.c file contains code for Tokenizer implementation
