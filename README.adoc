== May 20: Shift-reduce parsing LR(k) grammars

=== LR(k) grammars

LR(k) means *Left* to right, *Rightmost* derivation, with *k* tokens of lookahead.

LR(k) grammars are a subset of the context-free grammars, and a proper superset of the LL(k) grammars (the LL(k) grammars are a proper subset of the LR(k) grammars).
For a grammar to be LR(k):

* It must be unambiguous

LR(k) grammars can be parsed using 'shift-reduce'.

=== Shift-reduce parsing

Shift-reduce parsing is also known as bottom up parsing, because the parser works from the terminals up to the starting nonterminal.
A https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uncfFsbUF68[shift-reduce parser] shifts terminals onto a stack, and reduces the stack to a nonterminal when the stack matches the right hand side of a production (rule).
Programmers rarely write shift-reduce parsers by hand, and use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_generator[parser generators] or parser combinators instead.

=== First and follow sets

First set:: the set of terminals (excluding empty string) that can appear first in any derivation of a nonterminal.
Follow set:: the set of terminals (ecluding empty string) that can appear first *after* derivation of a nonterminal.

=== LL(k) grammars

LL(k) means parse from *Left* to right, *Leftmost* derivation, with at most *k* tokens of lookahead.

LL(k) grammars are a subset of the context-free grammars. For a grammar to be LL(k):

* The first and follow sets for each nonterminal must be disjoint
* It must be unambiguous
* No left-recursion is allowed
* No common prefixes on the right hand side are allowed

LL(k) grammars can be parsed using 'recursive descent'.

=== Recursive descent parsing

Recursive descent parsing is also known as top-down parsing, because the parse starts from the starting nonterminal.
Each nonterminal is a function, and the first and follow sets determine which production (rule) to choose.
See `RecursiveDescent.java` for an example recursive descent parser.

== May 15: Derivations and parsing

*Challenge*: What's the parse tree for `int a = 5;` using the http://lawrancej.github.io/COMP603-2015/CGrammar.pdf[C Grammar]?
*Hint*: It's a `declaration`.

. What was the most ridiculous thing you found? (funny comments? awful code?)
. Take notes along the way (if you find something that's unrelated to a compiler phase, try to infer what it's doing).
. Write up your findings in a short document and post to your repository (no more than two pages, please). For example:

== May 13: Chomsky, Derivatives, Compilers and Visitors, oh my!

=== Chomsky again

The Chomsky hierarchy is a containment hierarchy of languages.
Restrictions placed on grammar production rules
(or the underlying automaton) distinguish among language categories.

image:http://lawrancej.github.io/COMP603-2015/scribbles/chomsky-hierarchy.png[Chomsky hierarchy]

[cols="3", options="header"]
|===

|Language category
|Restrictions on grammar productions
|Equivalent automaton

|*Recursively-enumerable*
|*None*. Sequences of terminals and non-terminals may derive sequences of terminals and nonterminals.
|Finite automaton with infinite tape (Turing machine)

|*Context-sensitive*
|The same *context* (terminals or nonterminals) surrounds both sides of the nonterminal on the left, and the derivation on the right.
|Finite automaton with finite tape (Linearly-bounded Turing machine)

|*Context-free*
|A nonterminal derives sequences of terminals and nonterminals.
|Finite automaton with a stack (Pushdown automaton)

|*LR*
|Context-free but *forbids ambiguity*.
|Shift-reduce (bottom up) parser

|*LL*
|Context-free, the first and follow sets are disjoint, and forbids: ambiguity, left-recursion, and common prefixes.
|Recursive descent (top down) parser

|*Regular*
|A nonterminal may derive either terminals followed by a single nonterminal, or the empty string.
|Finite automaton

|*Finite*
|A nonterminal may derive terminals or the empty string.
|Finite automaton without cycles.

|===

=== Derivatives

http://matt.might.net/articles/parsing-with-derivatives/[A discussion of derivatives and parsing with them].

=== Compilers

Compilers consist of these 'phases':

[cols="4", options="header"]
|===
|Phase
|Description
|Input
|Output

|*Scan / Tokenize / Lexical analysis*
|Split source code into small chunks (tokens) such as identifiers, reserved words, literals, operators, etc.
|Source code
|Token stream

|*Parse*
|Check the syntax of the source code
|Token stream
|Parse tree

|*Translate*
|Translate low level syntax into high-level abstract syntax tree
|Parse tree
|Abstract syntax tree, symbol table

|*Optimize*
|Improve performance or structure
|Abstract syntax tree, symbol table
|Abstract synatx tree, symbol table

|*Generate code*
|Traverse the AST to generate code.
|Abstract syntax tree, symbol table
|Target code

|===

The *front-end* of a compiler consists of scanning and parsing;
the *back-end* consists of translation, optimization and code generation.

=== Visitors

Visitors visit (traverse) nodes in a tree to do some computation,
without mixing computation into the nodes themselves.

=== Challenge

Challenge: What's the parse tree for `int a = 5;` using the C Grammar?

== May 11: Regexes and Grammars

Cheat at http://puzzles.usatoday.com/[today's crossword puzzle],
the easy way with regexes!

----
cd ~/COMP603-2015
git pull upstream master
grep -E "^regex-goes-here$" american-english.txt
----

A *regular expression* (regex) defines a language with these primitives and operators.

[options="header"]
|===
|Name |Notation |Meaning

|*Primitives*
|
|Regular expression building block.

|*Empty Set*
|{}
|Reject everything.

|*Empty String*
|+""+
|Match the empty string.

|*Symbol*
|`a`
|Match a single character.

|*Operator*
|
|Make a new regex from existing regexes.

|*Sequence*
|`ab`
|Match regex `a` followed by regex `b`.

|*Alternation*
|`a\|b`
|Match regex `a` or match regex `b`, but not both.

|*Kleene Star*
|`a*`
|Match regex `a` zero or more times {+""+,`a`,`aa`,`aaa`,...}

|===

The primitives and operators above are *complete*:
we can define other regular expression operators in terms of them.
For example, `a?` optionally matches `a`; `a? = a|""`.
Another example: `a+` matches `a` 1 or more times; `a+ = a*a`.

Trivially, finite languages are regular:

----
finite language:  {"hello","cruel","world"}
equivalent regex: hello|cruel|world
----

Since regular languages can be infinite, they encompass the finite languages.

----
.* (Matches everything)
----

Regular languages can't express everything; 
for example, they cannot check matching brackets in the general case.
Hence, the other classes of languages.

The Chomsky hierarchy is a containment hierarchy of languages.
What distinguishes one language category from another is
restrictions placed on grammars or the underlying automaton.

image:http://lawrancej.github.io/COMP603-2015/scribbles/chomsky-hierarchy.png[Chomsky hierarchy]

A *grammar* consists of a finite set of nonterminals (variables),
a starting nonterminal, terminals (literals, words or symbols),
and productions (rules) that map among terminals and nonterminals.
Grammars define languages: they generate the set of strings in the language
and test membership of a string in the language.

The example grammar below defines a small subset of English, with an example sentence.
The example grammar is context-free because the left side of each arrow is a nonterminal.

== May 8: Introduction

NOTE: Please read http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/WirthPubl/CBEAll.pdf[Chapters 1, 2 and 3 (Pages 6-16)]
or Chapters 1, 2 and 3 of the Crafting a Compiler textbook by next week.
If this is overwhelming, read the first sentence of each paragraph,
then skip subsequent sentences if it made sense, otherwise read on.
https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md#compiler-design[See this list for other free books].

=== What is the difference between a set, a bag, and a sequence?

These are all collections.

A *set* is unordered and has no duplicates (no repeated values).

----
{ "hello", "world" } == { "world", "hello" }
----

A *bag* is unordered and allows duplicates (repeated values).

----
{ "buffalo", "my", "buffalo" } == { "my", "buffalo", "buffalo" }
----

A *sequence* is ordered and allows duplicates.

----
[ "hello", "cruel", "world" ] != [ "cruel", "world", "hello" ]
----

An *ordered set* is ordered and has no duplicates.

To summarize:

image:http://lawrancej.github.io/COMP603-2015/scribbles/collections.png[Kinds of collections]

=== What is a language in terms of sets and sequences?

English subset

----
{
    "This is a sentence in English.",
    "This is another sentence in English."
}
----

Espanol subseto?

----
{
    "Yo quiero Taco Bell",
    "Donde esta el bano?"
}
----

An *alphabet* is a set of symbols (e.g., `char`).
A *string* is a sequence of symbols chosen from some alphabet.

*Languages* are (possibly infinite) sets of strings.
A *grammar* constructs a language; *regular expressions* construct *regular* languages.

=== What is a compiler? Name some.

A *compiler* transforms source language into a target language.

javac, gcc, clang, etc.

=== What is an interpreter? How does that differ from a compiler?

An *interpreter* accepts code and runtime data and runs with it.
We're not generating code.
